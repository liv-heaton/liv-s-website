      <h2>Who am I?</h2>
      <p>My name is Liv Heaton, I'm about to graduate high school in Sydney's north-west. I have an avid interest in computers, both software and hardware.
        It all began when I was eleven and broke my foot and couldn't walk for a few months. My dad bought me a book to learn Python from, and by the time I could walk again,
        I had a moderate understanding of Python. <br><br>
          As an adult, I am still obsessed with coding. I blame my father. I have created multiple video games as projects, both 3D and 2D. I was the webmaster for my school's
        VET showcase and gained a deep understanding of HTML and CSS.</p>
